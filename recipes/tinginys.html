    <h2>Descripton:</h2>

        <p>One of the most delicious Lithuanian sweets! I haven’t met a single 
           person who doesn’t like the lazy cake!!! It doesn’t matter whether it
           is Lithuanian or a foreigner, a lazy cake is always liked by everyone. </p>

    <h2>Ingridients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>400 g (14 oz) sweet crispy cookies (like “Maria“, “Tostadas“)</li>
            <li>400 g (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>190 g (1 2/3 stick) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp. sweetened cocoa,1 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps to make:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Break cookies into the bowl (some in bigger pieces, others in smaller).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a pot with a thick bottom, then add sugar, heat it over low heat, and stir until sugar dissolves and you get one mass (make sure it doesn’t start boiling!).</li>
            <li>Then add unsweetened and sweetened cocoa, condensed milk and heat it up, stirring continually, until the syrup has no clumps. Take the pot off the heat and let it cool down a little.</li>
            <li>Add cookies in cocoa syrup, mix well and leave to cool a bit.</li>
            <li>Lay down a plastic wrap on the table, add cookies with cocoa and form a roll. Wrap it, press ends firmly, place roll in a refrigerator for at least 4 hours (the best is to leave it overnight). Slice it and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
