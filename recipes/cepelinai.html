            Cepelinai (lit.Tooltip literal translation "zeppelins"; singular: cepelinas) or didžkukuliai are 
            potato dumplings made from grated and riced potatoes and stuffed with ground meat, dry curd cheese
            or mushrooms. It has been described as a national dish of Lithuania,[2][3] and is typically served as a main dish.

            The name of cepelinai comes from their shape that resembles of a Zeppelin airship.[1] Cepelinai are typically around 10–20 cm long,
             although the size depends on where they are made: in the western counties of Lithuania cepelinai are made bigger than in the east.
             [citation needed] In Samogitia cepelinai are called cepelinā
